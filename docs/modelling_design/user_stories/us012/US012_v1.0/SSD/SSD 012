1ยบ The diagram starts with the Manager interacting with the System by selecting a project;
2ยบ The System then responds by displaying the project details to the Manager;
3ยบ The Manager then sets the role typology, then the System displays the roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team Member);
4ยบ The Manager then defines the Product Owner, and the System confirms that the Product Owner has been defined successfully;

Overall, this diagram provides a clear and concise illustration of the main steps and interactions involved in defining
the Product Owner for a project using the system.
