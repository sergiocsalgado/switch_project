CD 012 - As Manager, I want to define the PO of a project

# Primary Actor:

Manager

Resume User Story Scenario:

The Manager logs into the project management tool and navigates to the project settings.
The Manager selects the option to define the Product Owner (PO) of the project.
The Manager is presented with a form where they can enter the details of the PO, such as their name, contact information,
and role in the project. Then fills in the required information and submits the form.
The project management tool saves the information and assigns the designated PO to the project.
After that the Manager verifies that the PO has been assigned correctly by checking the project dashboard and seeing the
PO's name and contact information displayed prominently.
Consequently the Manager communicates the PO assignment to the project team and stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is
aware of who to contact for product-related decisions and updates.
In this success scenario, the Manager successfully defines the PO for the project, ensuring that there is a clear point
of contact for all product-related matters. This helps to streamline communication and decision-making, ultimately
leading to a more efficient and effective project outcome.
