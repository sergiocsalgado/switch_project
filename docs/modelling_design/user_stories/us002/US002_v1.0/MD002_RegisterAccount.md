The system should make it possible for the Administrator to register users through a form
accessible via a link in the login zone. Each user's registration must request at least the
following information:
 - Name;
 - E-mail;
 - Phone number;
 - Photo (optional).  
 
Creating accounts in the system must ensure that the email address used is unique.
When creating a new user account, the user is automatically associated with the "User"
profile. The first time that the user logs into the system he has to create a password.
As long as the account is not associated with another profile or the user added to a projectâ€™s
team, the User will only be able to edit some of her/his profile data.
